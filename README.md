# CHAT WITH DATA

This repository contains two interactive chatbot applications built with Streamlit.

## 1. Ollama Chatbot
The Ollama Chat application allows users to upload CSV or Excel files and interact with the data using a chatbot powered by the Langchain framework and Ollama's language model. Users can ask questions about the data, and the chatbot provides insightful responses based on the uploaded DataFrame.

## 2. Solstice Intuit
The Solstice Intuit application enables users to upload PDF documents and ask questions related to their content. It processes the PDFs to extract text, splits it into manageable chunks, and uses a generative AI model to provide detailed answers based on the context of the uploaded documents.

Both applications emphasize user-friendly interfaces for querying and interacting with different types of data.
